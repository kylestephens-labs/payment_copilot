awesome — I applied your constraints and folded in the useful bits from your optimization notes (and explicitly removed anything about a waitlist or “Stripe-only”). Here are the two clean docs you can review and mark up.

🚀 Payment Copilot — Business Plan (Solo Founder + AI, AWS, Stripe & PayPal)

1) Vision & POV
	•	Vision: The creator money cockpit — one clean dashboard for revenue, fees, payout timing, and momentum.
	•	POV: Not accounting. Clarity. Make income make sense in minutes, not hours. Confidence > complexity.

2) ICP & Positioning
	•	ICP (ultra-niche): Solo/small creators earning $1k–$15k/mo using Stripe + PayPal.
	•	Frustrations:
	•	“What do I actually take home after fees?”
	•	“When do I get paid next?”
	•	“Why am I flipping between dashboards?”
	•	Narrative: “Connect once. In five minutes know what’s coming, what you’re losing, and what you’ve truly earned — across Stripe + PayPal.”

3) Offer & Pricing (simple now, expandable later)
	•	Free Trial (14 days): Full access after connecting Stripe + PayPal.
	•	Starter: $29.99/mo — ongoing access, tax export, forecasts, all dashboards.
(Optional post-MVP path you can test later: Starter $29, Pro $49, Team $99. Keeping single tier for the MVP keeps decisions simple.)

4) Go-To-Market (100x Sales mindset, no waitlist)
	•	Arcade demo embedded on the landing page for instant proof.
	•	Plain-text outreach (AI-assisted):
“Hey {{name}}, noticed you run Stripe + PayPal for {{product}}. I built a cockpit that unifies both and shows real take-home + next payouts. Here’s a 90-sec demo.”
	•	Free trial with email auth (no passwords) → jump straight to connection flow.
	•	Community growth: Creator Money Signals (biweekly) with quick fee benchmarks & growth stats.
	•	Benchmark urgency: “Creators like you save an average of $42/mo by optimizing payout settings.”

5) Product Differentiation
	•	Instant clarity UX: Connect → see unified earnings, fees, and next payouts within minutes.
	•	Emotion-first copy: “You’ve earned $X 🎉” / “You lost $Y to fees 😤” / “Stripe payout in 3 days 💰”.
	•	Anonymous benchmarks: “Your fee rate is in the top 20% of similar creators.”

6) Tech & Ops Stack (AWS)

Layer	Tools
Hosting	AWS (Lambda/API Gateway or EC2), RDS Postgres, S3
Frontend	Next.js + Tailwind
Auth	Email-only (Cognito or custom tokens). Supports Gmail & others
Integrations	Stripe + PayPal via OAuth 2.0
Exports	CSV/PDF (S3)
Monitoring	CloudWatch + Sentry
Payments	Stripe Billing
Analytics	PostHog or Plausible (simple funnel tracking)

7) 0–90 Day Business Goals

Milestone	KPI
Week 1	Launch MVP w/ live Stripe + PayPal connections
Month 1	100 free-trial users (Arcade + outreach)
Month 2	40 paying users → $1.6k MRR
Month 3	150 paying users → $6k MRR

	•	North Star: Time-to-WOW < 10 minutes after signup.
	•	Core activation: % of users connecting both platforms and viewing dashboard in first session.

8) Risks & Mitigations
	•	API limits: Exponential backoff, queued syncs, user-visible “last updated” + manual refresh.
	•	Data accuracy: Confidence badges (e.g., “Stripe 100%, PayPal 95%”), reconcile totals vs payouts.
	•	Onboarding drop-off: Progressive checklist, instant preview (show partial stats while full import runs).
